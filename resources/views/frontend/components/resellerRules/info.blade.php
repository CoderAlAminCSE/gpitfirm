                <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reseller Terms &amp;
                            Conditions</strong></span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this section, we inform you that you must pay any reseller
                        who accepts Guest Posts from us within the payment deadline. If someone pays by the
                        deadline, the link to their post will be taken down and republished when they pay for
                        their targeted due links.</span></p>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Should You Have To Adhere To The List Of Sites?</span>
                </h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before sending articles, one more thing to think about is
                        always looking at our site list to get an idea of how much each site costs. Because our
                        prices are the cheapest and most competitive about market value, and because the price
                        cannot be changed, prices on some websites will fluctuate depending on administrative
                        decisions. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why you should keep an eye on the list on the
                        website. This thoughtful note will keep you from having any problems with us.</span></p>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Were The Links To Your Posts Removed?</span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that resellers will have three days to clear their
                        payments if they receive an invoice after live links. Their posts will be deleted
                        immediately following the payment deadline if they cannot pay. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This indicates that your posts were removed due to an unpaid
                        issue. This standard should be applied to all clients. It is a strict rule for
                        everyone.</span></p>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link Insert/Niche-Edit Removal Request </span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take posts from our sites and see live links, you
                        can&#8217;t ask us to remove those links if you see additional unknown backlinks on the
                        bar after a few months. You must mention it when you send the article to us if you want
                        to avoid niche editing and link insertion from your post because we allow niche editing
                        on our existing pieces. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be required to pay an additional fee for doing so.
                        After some discussion, the price will be set based on your backlink with us.</span></p>
                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-Payment Process</span></h2>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you send a single order with an estimated value of
                        less than 40 to 60 USD. However, you will need to pay a prepayment before we can provide
                        live links for any orders that exceed 100 USD in total, whether they are a batch or a
                        single charge. </span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be informed of the most current site rates, you must
                        follow up on our list, as previously stated.</span></p>
